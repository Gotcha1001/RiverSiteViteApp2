                    <p>
                        The goal of fasting is to draw nearer to God. Biblical fasting always has to do with eliminating distractions for a spiritual purpose; it hits the reset button of our soul and renews us from the inside out. It also enables us to celebrate the goodness and mercy of God and prepares our hearts for all the good things God desires to bring into our lives. Remember, your personal fast should present a level of challenge, but it is very important to know your body, your options, and, most importantly, to seek God in prayer and follow what the Holy Spirit leads you to do. God desires to grow us in faith during our Daniel fast. Make your first prayer request – Lord, I want to know You more.

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Complete Fast</h3>
                    <p>In this type of fast, you drink only liquids, typically water with light juices as an option.</p>
                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Selective Fast</h3>
                    <p>This type of fast involves removing certain elements from your diet. One example of a selective fast is the Daniel Fast, during which you remove meat, sweets, and bread from your diet and consume water and juice for fluids and fruits and vegetables for food.</p>
                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Partial Fast</h3>
                    <p>This fast is sometimes called the “Jewish Fast” and involves abstaining from eating any type of food in the morning and afternoon. This can either correlate to specific times of the day, such as 6:00 am to 3:00 pm, or from sunup to sundown.</p>
                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Soul Fast</h3>
                    <p>This fast is a great option if you do not have much experience fasting food, have health issues that prevent you from fasting food, or if you wish to refocus certain areas of your life that are out of balance. For example, you might choose to stop using social media or watching television for the duration of the fast and then carefully bring that element back into your life in healthy doses at the conclusion of the fast.</p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Fasting Basics</h2>
                    <p>
                        Simply stated, biblical fasting is refraining from food for a spiritual purpose.
                        According to the Bible, there are three duties of every Christian: give, pray, and fast.
                        Biblical fasting takes a lot of discipline and strength—strength which you can only receive from God. Your private discipline will bring you rewards in Heaven, says Matthew 6. When you give God your first through fasting, prayer, and giving at the beginning of the year, you set the course for the entire year.
