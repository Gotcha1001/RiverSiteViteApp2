                            Thatâ€™s why we are committed to creating safe and fun environments where your children are taught about the Bible and the love of Jesus through relevant, age-appropriate kids services. Our ultimate hope is to see a generation of children come to know God at an early age.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-4 text-white">
                            Children learn the Bible through age-appropriate activities like stories, crafts, and Bible action songs that reinforce Bible truths. They are also given the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with their friends and teachers. Our services are designed to present the love of Jesus to our kids in a way that is exciting and makes sense to them. Every week they get to play games, experience dynamic worship, work on a Bible story, learn an interesting object lesson, receive prayer, and make friends.
